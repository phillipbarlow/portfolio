                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>Hi, my name is Phil. I am Leeds born and bred and still live locally in a village on the outskirts of Bradford. I am married to my partner of 8 years, April, we have a 3 year old cockapoo called Nelly and have recently become a parents to our beautiful daughter, Indie.</p>
                    <p>When I get spare days I like to spend quality time with my family, going for long walks in local green spaces and travelling to Bridlington to visit my in-laws. When I am not doing family stuff I love to keep fit with lifting weights and jogging.</p>
                    <img src="./img/me.png" alt="" class="me">
                    <p>At the start of 2020 was when I realised I wanted to change careers and follow my interest for Web Development. At the time I was working as a Bench Hand Joiner and had been for 6 years after completing my Diploma at Leeds Building College in 2013. As much as I loved my job, the working conditions of a joiner teamed with childhood asthma was starting to really impact my breathing. In March 2020, just after I turned 30, my wife told me the best news; she was pregnant. I instantly knew I needed to change my career and with always having an interest in HTML & CSS also the fact that everything is moving online these days made me realise it was the best option for mine and my families prospects. I took the unfortunate event of COVID-19 and turned it into an opportunity to start Codecademy. My interest started to manifest into something much bigger, which led me to religiously watching YouTube videos and following tutorials, also reading beginner-friendly books such as “A Smarter Way to Learn HTML & CSS + A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript” by Mark Myers. In January 2021, I started a 12 week reboot course with Leeds Trinity University via Microsoft Teams which was held on a Tuesday and Thursday night, this has helped me gain the majority of my knowledge to date. </p>
                    <p>My next step is to hopefully secure an entry level role and work my way up to becoming a Junior Developer. I am willing to do what ever it takes to show my daughter you really can be whatever you want to be as long as you put your mind to it!</p>
